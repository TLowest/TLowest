# Welcome👋

Hello! I’m a cybersecurity student with hands-on experience across multiple IT domains. I believe that modern cybersecurity professionals must understand the broader IT landscape — not just security tools, but also how infrastructure, networks, and automation work together to protect systems effectively.

To support this vision, I’m building a comprehensive portfolio that reflects both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, developed through coursework, self-guided projects, and industry-recognized certifications.

### About Me 

🎓 **Cybersecurity Technology Student** at  [<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e5cdccf-65cf-4c2e-b0ab-070c3fae1c64" width="20" height="20" />](https://www.umgc.edu/)**University of Maryland Global Campus**

🚀 Passionate about **DevOps**, **SecOps**, **Networking**, **System Administration**, and **Cloud Infrastructure**

🏢 Over 3 years of IT experience at **Warner Bros. Discovery**, most recently working as a 👨‍💻**System Administrator** focused on platform operations and operational tooling (OT) support for digital infrastructure.

🎯 Actively seeking opportunities in **Cybersecurity Operations**, including **SOC Analyst**, **Security Engineer**, or other **InfoSec** roles — ready to contribute, learn, and grow in a dynamic security team!

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

Here are some projects I’ve completed to strengthen my DevOps and SecOps skills. Many of these are inspired by the [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops) DevOps learning path:

### 🔹 [Static Site Server](https://github.com/TLowest/static-site-server)
Provisioned and secured an EC2 instance on AWS to host a static HTML/CSS website using **Nginx** and **rsync** for deployment. Demonstrates Linux server setup, SSH hardening, and Nginx configuration.

### 🔹 [Server Performance Stats](https://github.com/TLowest/server-performance-stats)
A lightweight Bash utility to monitor **CPU**, **memory**, **disk usage**, and more on Linux systems. Designed for CLI environments and Cron integration.

### 🔹 [Simple Monitoring with Netdata](https://github.com/TLowest/simple-monitoring-netdata)
Implemented real-time system health dashboards using **Netdata** to visualize system metrics in a home lab environment.

### 🔹 [File Integrity Checker](https://github.com/TLowest/file-integrity-checker)
Built a secure Bash script that computes **SHA-256** hashes of critical log files to detect unauthorized changes. Ideal for basic **intrusion detection** in Linux environments.

## 🔍 What I'm Working On

I'm currently expanding my hands-on skills by building out real-world, infrastructure-focused projects that bridge cybersecurity, DevOps, and system administration:

- ⚙️ **Configuration Management**  
  Writing an Ansible playbook to automate the setup of a Linux server — installing packages, configuring services, and establishing baseline security controls. A foundational project in infrastructure as code (IaC).

- 🐳 **Multi-Container Application with Docker Compose**  
  Using Docker Compose to orchestrate a Node.js application with a MongoDB backend, simulating a basic microservice deployment suitable for production environments.

- 📊 **Prometheus and Grafana Monitoring Stack**  
  Deploying a comprehensive monitoring solution using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. The system provides real-time performance and resource insights across Linux servers.

- 🧱 **Multi-Service Docker Application**  
  Simulating a real-world application stack using a modular Docker setup:
  - **Frontend:** React-based web interface  
  - **Backend API:** Node.js with Express  
  - **Database:** MongoDB for persistent storage  
  - **Cache:** Redis for response speed optimization  
  - **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx to route and secure traffic  
  Includes advanced Docker techniques like multi-stage builds, volume management, custom base images, and secret handling.

These projects are helping me refine key SecOps and DevSecOps concepts while reinforcing skills in automation, observability, and secure service deployment.
